[buildless](https://less.build), [micronaut v4](https://docs.micronaut.io/4.0.0-M2/guide/index.html),

## Details about this sample

`1.9`, which is still in `beta`. It is used as an integration test and canary for [Buildless](https://less.build).

## Running this sample

It's a regular Gradle codebase, expressed as a single module, so you can just do:

```
./gradlew run
```

## Running the tests

You guessed it:

```
./gradlew test
```
